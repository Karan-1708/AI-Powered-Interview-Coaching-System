# *AI-Powered Interview Coaching System*

### *Overview*
The AI-Powered Interview Coaching System is a locally hosted software application designed to democratize access to high-quality, secure interview preparation. Unlike resource-constrained university career centers or costly cloud-based solutions, this project provides unlimited, private practice for behavioral interviews, leveraging advanced AI technologies.

#### *Key features include:*
-  Textual interview questions and simulated scenarios
-  Microphone-based response recording with automatic transcription via Whisper
-  Multi-modal evaluation of responses, including acoustic analysis (e.g., speaking rate, pauses) via librosa
-  Semantic analysis of responses using local LLMs (Llama 3 via Ollama)
-  Feedback and grading aligned with the STAR framework (Situation, Task, Action, Result)

#### *Motivation*
Behavioral interviews evaluate communication, emotional intelligence, and the ability to articulate experiences concisely—skills that are traditionally difficult to practice at scale. This tool addresses systemic inefficiencies and inequities in interview preparation, offering a secure, private, and fully offline solution.
